# Lost and Found Redefined
####This is a hybrid app for Lost and Found of IITH

While IITH has an existing lost and found portal, it is not being used. I think it is because nobody is patient enough to go to that website to report found items and no one bloody checks it.

I think a lost and found app with push notifications will solve the issue.
